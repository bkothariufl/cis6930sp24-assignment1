Madireddy, Sree Vaishnavi | madireddy.s@ufl.edu | Discussed the general outline of the assignment, consulted when stuck with a gradescope failing test case for code failed to run. We together identified that it was due to a model import error as we both were using the same spacy model.

Tonpe, Aishwarya Prasad | tonpea@ufl.edu | Gave me the idea of exploring the pyap module for parsing addresses as my previous logic using spacy was inefficient.

ChatGPT | https://chat.openai.com/ | Helped me basic linux commands when stuck and with regular expression testing.

StackOverflow/github Post | https://github.com/BramVanroy/spacy_download | Helped fix the issue with loading the spacy model when run in vm and gradescope without python download command.
